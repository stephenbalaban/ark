Description: 
        This provides a simple but versatile messaging system, ideal for decoupling
        parts of your application: senders and listeners don't need to know about
        each other.
        
        Version 2 provides pubsub2, which should be used instead of pubsub:
        
        - pubsub2 provides better handling of exceptions
        - allows tools like pylint/pychecker to verify validity of message types
        - facilitates the documentation of message types and message data
        - supports customizable logging (incl no logging, the default)
        - support debugging of the send/receive dispatches
        
        The only real change from pubsub is that class are used instead of
        strings for the message topics, and a whole whack of code is no
        longer needed (tree and its traversal, dictionary of weak references,
        etc).
        
        Version 1 is still available as pubsub, for backwards compatibility,
        but it is depracated.
        
        Todo:
        
        - include the traceback in the exception info
        - support subtopic access in supertopic messages
