Description: Pypubsub provides a simple way for parts of your Python application
        to send messages (like signals) to each other: parts of your
        application can publish messages and other parts can subscribe/receive
        them. This allows message "senders" and message "listeners" to be
        unaware of each other:
        * one doesn't need to import the other
        * a sender doesn't need to know
        * "who" gets the messages,
        * what the listeners will do with the data,
        * or even if any listener will get the message data.
        * similarly, listeners don't need to worry about where messages come from.
        
        This is a great tool for implementing a Model-View-Controller
        architecture or any similar architecture that promotes decoupling
        of its components.
        
        Note:
        
        This pubsub package was originally one module in wxPython's lib
        package. It was extracted from wxPython and improved so that there
        is absolutely no dependency on wxPython or any third party libraries.
        The original pubsub API is still supported for those who need it,
        but is no longer maintained.
        
        See the Pypubsub website (http://pubsub.wiki.sourceforge.net/) for
        further details. Download area is at
        http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=197063.
        
        Notes:
        
        * The next release of wxPython should contain PyPubSub. The default will
        likely be for it to use version 1.
        * This project is hosted on SourceForge as pubsub (www.sf.net/projects/pubsub).
        It should not be confused with the PyPubSub (www.sf.net/projects/pypubsub)
        project also hosted there, providing a form of network-based publish-subscribe.
        The author of the latter was not aware of our pre-existing PyPubSub on
        Cheeseshop when they created it, and has only recently agreed to change
        their project name, but that hasn't happened yet.
