Pubsub Home page
================

.. note:: Latest API released is v3.1.1b1 from May 2010

The Python Pubsub package provides a publish - subscribe API that allows data to 
be sent between independent parts of your application. For instance, between the 
GUI components and the Application Controller. Using publish - subscribe in your 
application can dramatically simplify its design and improve testability. Robin
Dunn, the creator of wxPython, summerizes it nicely:

	Basically you just have some part(s) of your program 
	subscribe to a particular topic and have some other part(s) 
	of your program publish messages with that topic.  All the 
	plumbing is taken care of by pubsub.  -- *Robin Dunn, Jun 2007*

Using publish - subscribe in an application can sometimes
dramatically simplify its design and improve testability. This is 
explained further in the :ref:`label-usage` section.
