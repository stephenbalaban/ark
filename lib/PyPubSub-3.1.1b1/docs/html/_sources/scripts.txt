Scripts Available
------------------

The following is likely to be useful to pubsub developers and contributors only.

*Testing*:
    The package currently gets tested on Windows XP only. The tests can be
    run automatically by running :command:`runtests.bat` from the :file:`tests`
    folder of a source distribution.

    If anyone is able to run the test suite on other platforms, please let
    me know of the results. A Linux person will have no
    trouble running the equivalent batch commands on Linux.

*Documentation*:
    The documentation can be generated on Windows by running
    :command:`gendocs.bat` from the :file:`docs` folder of a source
    distribution. For Linux, again you should be able to
    just copy the commands form the :file:`.bat` file to a shell window.

*Performance*:
    A small performance test is available in the :file:`tests` folder.
    On Windows, run it via :command:`runperf.bat`.
