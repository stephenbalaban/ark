Versions 
---------

Note that there are are three major "versions" of pubsub. Version 1 is still
maintained as it is the one in use in wxPython, where pubsub originated. 
Version 2 is no longer maintained as it was superseded by version 3. Version 3
has been around for over a year and has reached maturity. It will continue 
to be maintained. The default version selected is version 3, but you can 
select an older major version via::

    # in top level script/module:
    import pubsubconf
    pubsubconf.setVersion(1) # or 2 or 3 (default)

Note: if your application uses pubsub version 1, you have the choice of 
setting an option in pubsub to make it continue to use version 1, without 
all the benefits of the latest version. OR, you may have upgrade your code. 
Some :ref:`suggested steps are available <label-upgrade_v1tov3>`.
